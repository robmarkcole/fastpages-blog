## Introduction
On Twitter & LinkedIn I regularly post on the topic of deep learning applied to satellite & aerial imagery, and I receive many messages from people who want to get hands on with this topic but are unsure of how to get started. I maintain a popular repository on Github called the [satellite-image-deep-learning](https://github.com/robmarkcole/satellite-image-deep-learning) which lists many useful references, ranging from very introductory articles on Medium to code for cutting edge techniques published in the academic literature. This has become a very long list of references which is not necessarily approachable to people getting started in this area. Therefore in order to assist these people I am going to publish a series of 'Getting started with ..' blog posts, addressing the techniques listed in my repo in approximately the order they are listed in there. To begin this series this post is on the classification of imagery, which whilst a conceptually simple technique, actually has many practical applications. Lets get started

##Â What is image classification?
You will probably already be familiar with image classification from the numerous cats vs dogs image classification tutorials on the internet. Image classification is therefore the task of assigning a label to an image, or even assigning multiple labels to an image[^1]. When applied to satellite imagery, single label classification may be used to:

- label the dominant subject of image, e.g. golf course, harbour
- perform binary detection of some subject, e.g. ship present or not

A benchmark dataset used in image classification is the UC merced dataset, a sample of which is shown below:

## Footnotes
[^1]: When there are **more** than one label to be associated with an image the task is usually referred to as 'multi-class' or 'multi-label' classification. This more complex task is beyond the scope of this post but I aim to revisit in a later post
