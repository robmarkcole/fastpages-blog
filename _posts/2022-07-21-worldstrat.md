# The WorldStrat Dataset

A new dataset called the WorldStrat dataset was this week announced on Twitter by Julien Cornebise and colleagues. The release includes a paper on arXiv[^1], code on Github[^2], and the dataset itself on both Zenodo[^3] and Kaggle[^4].

This dataset is significant for a number of reasons:

- Greater than 100 GB of imagery with global coverage
- Covers locations typically under-represented in ML datasets
- Colocated low and high resolution imagery enables training of super resolution models
- Code provided to extend the dataset
- Models & tutorials provided

The dataset comprises Sentinel 2 timeseries & colocated high resoluton Airbus SPOT imagery providing 10 & 1.5 m/pixel respectively. An example is shown below:

## Getting started
I followed the instructions in the repository readme and downloaded the smaller dataset from Kaggle. The zipped Kaggle dataset is 53GB and even on a fast internet connection, the download took 3-4 hours. Alternatively I could have just created a notebook on Kaggle itself, and would not have needed to wait for a download. I began by running the [Dataset Exploration.ipynb](https://github.com/worldstrat/worldstrat/blob/main/Dataset%20Exploration.ipynb) notebook, which gives an introduction to the dataset. Interestingly the imagery locations were suggested by several organisations:

- 22 Ã— 22.5kmÂ² images of Amnesty provided locations or 198 Ã— 2.5kmÂ² images.
- 39 Ã— 22.5kmÂ² images of ASMSpotter provided locations or 351 Ã— 2.5kmÂ² images.
- 981 Ã— 2.5kmÂ² images of UNHCR provided locations.
- 2,407 Ã— 2.5kmÂ² images of randomly sampled/stratified locations.

Several maps are generated using [folium](http://python-visualization.github.io/folium/) which show the capture location of the images. The image metadata is visualised in a pandas dataframe, and includes lat/lon, the source (e.g. Amnesty, UNHCR etc.) and a description field. Some very interesting locations are included, such as `Camp 25, North Korea- Gulag`, `USA - migrant camps on border` and `Brazil-Jaci_Deforestation_Cattle`

## Super resolution
The colocated low and high resolution imagery enables the training of super resolution models
