# The WorldStrat Dataset

A new dataset called the WorldStrat dataset was this week [announced on Twitter](https://twitter.com/JCornebise/status/1549356696664956928?s=20&t=0vTPK4qaRNRtx3YCHpA7Rg) by Julien Cornebise and colleagues. The release includes a paper on arXiv, code on Github, and the dataset itself on both Zenodo and Kaggle. This dataset is significant for a number of reasons:

- Greater than 100 GB of imagery with global coverage
- Colocated low and high resolution imagery
- Code provided to extend the dataset
- Models & tutorials provided

The dataset comprises Sentinel 2 timeseries & colocated high resoluton Airbus SPOT imagery providing 10 & 1.5 m/pixel respectively. A couple of examples are shown below:


## Super resolution
The colocated low and high resolution imagery enables the training of super resolution models
