# The WorldStrat Dataset

A new dataset called the WorldStrat dataset was this week [announced on Twitter](https://twitter.com/JCornebise/status/1549356696664956928?s=20&t=0vTPK4qaRNRtx3YCHpA7Rg) by Julien Cornebise and colleagues. The release includes code on Github, a paper on arXiv, and the dataset itself on both Zenodo (full dataset) and on Kaggle. This dataset is significant for a number of reasons:

- Large volume of imagery with global coverage
- Sentinel 2 & high resoluton SPOT imagery providing 10 & 1.5 m/pixel respectively

## The code
The [code on Github](https://github.com/worldstrat/worldstrat) allows anyone to rebuild or extend the WorldStrat dataset. Additionally it includes baeline algorithms & model implementation details to perform super resolution, and a number of tutorials.

## The paper
The [paper on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06418)

## Full dataset on Zenodo
The full 107 GB dataset is [hosted on Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/6810792#.YtjNb-zMK3I)

## Reduced size dataset on Kaggle
A reduced size, 53 GB version of the dataset [is on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jucor1/worldstrat).
