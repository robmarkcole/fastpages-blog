## Introduction
I will admit that whenever I hear Transformers, the first image that flashes through my mind is that of the cartoon characters I remember from my childhood in the 1980's. And whilst that was, and continues to be a great TV & film series, the Transformers I wish to talk about are those making waves in the deep learning community. So first things first, what is a Transformer? The Transformer is a neural network architecture first published in a 2017 paper titled [Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) by researchers at Google. Transformers learn context by tracking relationships in sequential data using a technique called *attention*. Transformers are replacing CNN‚Äôs and RNN‚Äôs in many applications and have come to dominate the field of natural language processing[^1] in only a few years.

Transformers were successfully applied to imagery in the 2020 paper [An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929), again by researchers at Google. Transformers applied to vision are commonly referred to as Vision Transformers, or ViT. I will not go deep into deep technical details here since those are covered in the paper and elsewhere, but the first figure from the paper is worth reproducing here along with a basic explanation of the core features of ViT's:

The caption from the figure above explains: *We split an image into fixed-size patches, linearly embed each of them, add position embeddings, and feed the resulting sequence of vectors to a standard Transformer encoder. In order to perform classification, we use the standard approach of adding an extra learnable ‚Äúclassification token‚Äù to the sequence.* We can see that there are absolutely **no convolutional layers**, and the authors note that the ViT *has much less image-specific inductive bias than CNNs. In CNNs, locality, two-dimensional neighborhood structure, and translation equivariance are
baked into each layer throughout the whole model. In ViT, only MLP layers are local and translationally equivariant, while the self-attention layers are global.* This results in ViT's requiring larger data volumes to achieve comparable levels of performance to CNN's. Indeed a ViT trained on ImageNet (1M images), under-performs a CNN. However with significantly larger data volumes (300M images), the ViT outperforms the CNN. Also a ViT is able to capture more global relationships in an image, which hints at their potential benefits when applied to remote sensing imagery. Note that in practice it is typical to fine tune a ViT that has been pre-trained, just as we usually do with a CNN. For further reading I also recommend reading the original Google [blog post on transformers](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/12/transformers-for-image-recognition-at.html), and if you are interested in a pytorch implementation of a ViT see [vit-pytorch](https://github.com/lucidrains/vit-pytorch).

## Transformers in remote sensing
Relatively recently I have started noticing greater numbers of remote sensing publications using Transformers. I became curious about the level of interest and understanding of Transformers in the remote sensing community, and a Tweet about this got many responses:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">What questions do people have about Transformers and their use in remote sensing? This is the topic of my next blog post üôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüöÄ</p>&mdash; Robin Cole (@robmarkcole) <a href="https://twitter.com/robmarkcole/status/1554348041926311937?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 2, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

To paraphrase the questions asked:
- What are the benefits of Transformers over CNN's?
- Do they require more training data than CNN's?
- Is there a minimum data volume requirement?
- Are they harder to train than CNN's?
- Are there significant engineering tradeoffs in using Transformers?
- Can Transformers be used for segmentation & small object detection?
- Are transformers of any use for tabular remote sensing data?

## Nomenclature
- CNN: convolutional neural network
- RNN: recurrent neural network
- ViT: vision transformer
